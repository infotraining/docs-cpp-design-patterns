# Four tenets of object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.

It utilizes several techniques to design and develop software. The four major principles of object-oriented programming are:

1. Abstraction

    * Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.

2. Encapsulation

    * Encapsulation (aka information hiding) is the process of bundling the **data** (variables) and the **methods** (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. All internal details of the class should be hidden from the outside world, and only the necessary interface that allows to operate on an object is exposed to the user.

3. Polymorphism

    * It allows to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows to define one interface and have multiple implementations.

4. Code Reusability: Composition & Inheritance

    * Composition and inheritance are two ways to achieve code reusability in object-oriented programming.
