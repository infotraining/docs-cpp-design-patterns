# S.O.L.I.D. Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

```{important}
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should have only one job (responsibility).
```

## Open/Closed Principle

```{important}
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
```

## Liskov Substitution Principle

```{important}
Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality of the program.
```

## Interface Segregation Principle

```{important}
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
```

## Dependency Inversion Principle

```{important}
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).

2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
```
