# S.O.L.I.D. Principles

SOLID is an acronym representing five key design principles for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) and aim to make software systems more maintainable, scalable, and flexible. Here's what SOLID stands for:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Every class should have one and only one reason to change. In essence, each class should handle only one responsibility to keep it focused and cohesive.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension (adding new functionality) but closed for modification (no need to alter existing code). This makes systems easier to expand without introducing bugs into existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses should be able to replace their parent class without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a subclass must behave like objects of their superclass.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead, break larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. This reduces coupling and increases flexibility.
